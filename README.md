A Python course walkthrough on specialized collections
Explores:
* How to create a set and a frozenset.
* How to add to a set (we won’t be able to mutate a frozenset).
* How to remove from a set (we won’t be able to mutate a frozenset).
* How to find specific elements in a set and a frozenset.
* How to perform set operations such as unions, intersections, and more.

# Sets
## Introduction to Sets

a set is a group of elements that are unordered and do not contain duplicates. Although it may seem that the usefulness of this data structure is limited, it can actually be very helpful for organizing items and performing set mathematics.
